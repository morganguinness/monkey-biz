# Monkey Business â€” Netlify Ready (CRA + Tailwind)

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Build for Netlify
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `build/`

If you're connecting from Git, Netlify will auto-detect these. If you prefer manual deploy, run the build and drag the `build/` folder into Netlify's **Deploys** tab.
